# 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

## Descritption
The goal of the project is to deploy on your server a simple copy of the[AirBnB website.](https://www.airbnb.com/)
The task is to make a clone of the website and build it and finally have it hosted in a server.
At the end of the project, we will have a complete web application composed by:

 * A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
 * A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
 * A database or files that store data (data = objects)
 * An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

### Tasks
1. A command prompt interpreter.
	This is the starting front end to interact with the appllication,
	Will be build using the cmd module.

2.
